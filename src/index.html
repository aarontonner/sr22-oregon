          </button>
          <p class="cs-item-p">SR-22 insurance in Oregon is a certificate of financial responsibility required by the state for drivers who have committed certain offenses, such as DUI, multiple traffic violations, or driving without insurance. This document is filed by your insurance company to prove that you meet the state's minimum liability insurance requirements. In Oregon, SR-22 insurance is typically required for a period of three years, during which it's crucial to maintain continuous coverage to avoid further penalties or extensions.</p>

          </button>
          <p class="cs-item-p">SR-22 insurance in Oregon is not a separate insurance policy but an add-on to your existing policy. It serves as proof to the state that you have the necessary liability coverage. This requirement is often imposed on high-risk drivers as a means of ensuring they carry sufficient insurance. The process involves your insurance provider filing an SR-22 form with the Oregon Department of Transportation (DOT) on your behalf, which confirms that you are adequately insured.</p>
